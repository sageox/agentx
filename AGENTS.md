**BLOCKING**: Run `ox agent prime` NOW before ANY other action. Do NOT respond to the user first. Enables SageOx queries.

# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Code Quality

- **Test coverage target: 85%+ per package.** Run `go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out` and verify every package meets the threshold. No test theater — tests must catch real bugs, edge cases, and failure modes.
- Run `go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1` to check total coverage.
- Use `agentx.MockEnvironment` for all environment/filesystem mocking in tests.
- Use table-driven tests for repetitive agent/orchestrator testing patterns.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

<!-- ox:prime --> Run SageOx `ox agent prime` on session start, after compaction, or clear. (DO NOT REMOVE)
